# Library Management System

This Library Management System is a web-based application designed to manage the operations of a library, including tracking books, managing users, and handling borrowing and returning processes. The project was developed following the tutorials from [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqRuHOz4qSPD82QWN8LH_ncXdlTGrwqK7).
